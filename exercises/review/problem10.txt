Moderate Problem: Integer sums

Given a list of integers, find the sum of all elements occurring more than once.
For example, the list [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5] should evaluate to 6, because 1 and
5 occur multiple times, and they add up to 6.

Hint: First create a list of integers containing duplicate elements and then do
a sum of all the numbers in the list.
