Simple Problem: A Linear-Exponential Function 

Copy either yours or the provided solution to problem 1 under 
exercises/classes/ to a file named "exponential.py". In the same directory but 
in a separate file, write a class which implements a linear-exponential 
function (i.e. f(x) ~ xe^x as opposed to f(x) ~ e^x). 

Correct solutions will inherit from the exponential object in the separate 
file, and will exponentially decay for positive values of the property "rate". 

Not counting whitespace, the provided solution to this problem is only 
four lines of code.
