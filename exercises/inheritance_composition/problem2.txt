Challenge Problem: A case-insensitive dictionary 

Subclass the built-in type "dict" to implement a dictionary which is 
case-insensitive (i.e. it'll respond to strings regardless of upper- or 
lower-case letters - example["foo"] and example["FOO"] will both achieve the 
same result). This will require overriding the inherited "__init__", 
"__getitem__", and "__setitem__" functions. Accept only keyword arguments 
(and an arbitrary number thereof) in your overridden __init__ function. 

Correct solutions will allow assignment of non-string keys after creation of 
a case-insensitive dictionary and retain the ability to be indexed by types 
that aren't strings. 

Hint: This can be accomplished in a small number of lines (~20 counting 
whitespace) by simply exploiting the ".lower()" function for strings.
