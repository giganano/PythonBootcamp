Moderate Problem: Pets in Python 

Create a base class "pet" which you will subclass twice to create a dog and 
a cat class. Give all pets a property "name". 

Give both the cat and dog subclasses a function "play" which prints a message 
saying that the pet is chasing a laser pointer if it's a cat and playing fetch 
if it's a dog. Give the cat a function "meow" and the dog a function "bark", 
which also prints what the dog or cat says to the console. 

Correct solutions will have no __init__ function in either the dog or the 
cat class. Why aren't these necessary?
