Tools 
=====
This is a synopsis of the tools you'll need if you're participating in this 
bootcamp. 


* A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) 
	Many astronomers now write a majority of their python code in Jupyter 
	Notebooks. However, notebooks are restrictive in that code is not easily 
	shared between multiple files. This is much easier when the code is 
	written in plain text files with the extension ``.py``; python code written 
	in this format can also be imported into your Jupyter Notebooks. 

	An IDE differs from a text editor in that the IDE has the capability to 
	run your code, and usually also provides an ``ipython`` interface. Popular 
	options are `Spyder`__ (included with `Anaconda`__), `PyCharm`__, and 
	the Python Foundation's own IDE `IDLE`__. If you choose to work with an 
	IDE rather than a text editor, beware that some have the added downside 
	of being dedicated to a specific language. 

	You're welcome to use whichever text editor or IDE you please for this 
	bootcamp. If you do not have one or don't have a preference in the matter, 
	my personal favorite is `Sublime Text`__.

* A Unix terminal 
	There are various forms of command-line interpreters, but they all fit into 
	one of two categories: Unix-derived and DOS-derived. Microsoft's PowerShell 
	is an example of a DOS-derived command line, whereas Linux operating 
	systems as well as the Mac OS are derived from Unix. On Linux, the dominant 
	command line is the Bourne Again SHell (bash). Bash is extended by the 
	Z SHell (ZSH), which is the default interpreter on the Mac OS since 
	Catalina. There are `some minor differences between Bash and ZSH`__, though 
	Mac OS allows users to revert to a bash default. 

	If you're a Windows user, I recommend upgrading to Windows 10 version 
	>= 18362.0 if you haven't already. Then, download the `Windows Terminal`__ 
	from the Microsoft Store, and 
	`enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`__. 
	This will allow the use of a Unix terminal within the Windows operating 
	system; other terminal utilities in Windows use PowerShell, the DOS-derived 
	command line with different syntax. Astronomy is dominated by Linux and Mac 
	OS, and thus also the Unix terminal. You're welcome to use PowerShell if 
	that's what you're most comfortable with, but if you're new to the command 
	line, I recommend focusing your efforts on learning Unix rather than 
	PowerShell syntax. It's not required for this bootcamp that you use one or 
	the other, though Unix is the better option for astronomers who are new to 
	the terminal. 

	If you're a Mac OS user, I recommend `iTerm2`__ over the built-in terminal 
	application, because it allows much more customization of the user 
	interface.
